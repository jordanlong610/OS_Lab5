# OS_Lab5

A program that translates logical to physical addresses for a virtual 
address space of size 2^16 = 65,536 bytes. Reads from a file containing logical 
addresses and, using a TLB as well as a page table, translates each logical address to its 
corresponding physical address and outputs the value of the byte stored at the translated physical 
address. This program simulates the steps involved in translating logical to physical addresses.
